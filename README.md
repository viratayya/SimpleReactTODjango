# SimpleReactTODjango

- The main aim is to simplify the User efforts by Automating the process of creating Bootstrap UI with React Js(Which is Client-Side javascript library) which include basics elements like navigation, lists, form etc. 
-	Ya, I am sure there is Django Admin but the problem is, the whole rendering of HTML takes place on the server-side which will reduce the performance of the server, so the proposal is to sift the process to Client-side using React Js.
-	And this project is still in the initial stage where the plane is to Create React Js Application which will take the inputs from Django Server and reproduce the Basic Elements in client-side with simple JSON data.
